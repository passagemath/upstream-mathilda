/*
 * fi_dixon.c — Dixon's random-squares method.
 *
 * Dixon draws random x and keeps those whose square residue z == x^2
 * (mod N) factors over a base of small primes; a GF(2) dependency among the
 * exponent vectors gives X^2 == Y^2 (mod N).  Textbook Dixon takes x
 * uniformly, so z is as large as N and almost never smooth.  Here each x is
 * drawn as floor(sqrt(kN)) + j with random k < 2^16 and random j < 2^20, so
 * z = x^2 - kN is only O(j sqrt(kN)) — the residues are square-root sized,
 * which is what makes the method usable at all, while the choices stay
 * random and every residue is trial divided (no sieve: that refinement is
 * the quadratic sieve).  Since k varies, every prime can divide some z, so
 * the base is all primes up to the bound.
 *
 * Shares batched factor-base trial division with early abort, the single
 * large-prime variation, linear algebra and square roots with CFRAC.
 *
 * Threads (fi_smooth.c): the main thread draws a batch of random words from
 * the context generator, the workers build and trial-divide the candidates,
 * and the hits are replayed in draw order; afterwards the generator is left
 * exactly where the serial loop would have left it.  Relations, solves, the
 * divisor and the random stream are therefore those of the serial method.

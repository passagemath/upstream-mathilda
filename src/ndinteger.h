/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ndinteger.c — exact-integer NDArray kernels for the number-theoretic heads.
 *
 * ndkernels.c owns the libc-expressible elementary and special functions: every
 * kernel there computes in `double` and its exactness question is only ever
 * "does this real answer round-trip". These are the opposite kind. GCD, LCM,
 * EulerPhi, MoebiusMu, DivisorSigma, IntegerLength, PowerMod, Prime and
 * IntegerDigits are defined on Z, their answers are exact Integers, and a
 * `double` intermediate is not an approximation of the answer but a different
 * answer. So they are written in int64 end to end, through the ci_*_i64
 * overflow-checked helpers, and ABANDON the whole array the moment a result
 * would not fit — the List path then re-runs the call and GMP answers exactly.
 * Never wrap, never round: the same contract as the narrowing kernels in
 * ndkernels.c and Total's int64 accumulate.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `Mod[Range[10^6] 7919, 1000]` is how an integer array is
 * made, and until it kept its buffer every consumer downstream paid. The eighth
 * round fixed Mod and Quotient and left the rest of the integer domain with no
 * kernel at all: `GCD[cv, 1234]` and its seven siblings answered a visible
 * NDArray with the unevaluated call and a packed List with one Expr per
 * element. The natural next batch, and the same reasoning — an integer pipeline
 * is only as packed as its least-aware link.

/* ---- head-level buffer paths ------------------------------------------- *
 * Three heads cannot be expressed as an element kernel and get their own entry
 * point, called from the head's builtin before it does anything else. Each
 * returns NULL for any shape it does not handle, leaving the builtin's ordinary
 * path untouched.
 *
 *   Prime      per-element Prime[n] is a Meissel-style prime count each time.
 *              Over an array the answer is a SIEVE: one pass to the largest
 *              requested index's upper bound, then a gather. That is a
 *              different algorithm, not a different loop, which is why it
 *              cannot be a kernel.
 *   PowerMod   ternary — PowerMod[b, e, m] — and NDUnary/NDBinaryKernel cannot
 *              express three arguments.
 *   IntegerDigits  the result is RAGGED (a list per element, of differing
 *              lengths), so no buffer holds it. The win is on the INPUT side:
 *              read the buffer directly instead of materialising 10^6 Integers
 *              only to read each one back out again.

 * for k < 0, for any overflow, and (ndint_divisor_sigma_i64) for n == 0 or
